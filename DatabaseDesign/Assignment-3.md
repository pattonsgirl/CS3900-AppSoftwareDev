# Database Design - Assignment 3 - Physical Model

## Purpose / Objectives

- Apply knowledge / concepts from pre-requisite videos.
- Understand purpose and audience of the physical model.
- Understand basic physical model concepts.
- Create a physical model of your group project theme.
- Improve your physical model via peer-review critiques.
	- Review will be done in following class session and changes made when submitting Assignment 4

## Description

The intent is to learn about physical models and build one using your group project’s theme.

1. In your `dbdesign-assignments-YOURGHUSERNAME` repository, edit the file `DB-Assignment-3.md` in the `Assignments` folder.
2. Watch the required videos (listed in the [Assignment-3-required.md](Assignment-3-required.md) file)
3. Write a description of the following common physical model components:
	- Key difference of the physical model compared to the conceptual and logical models
	- What are the common data types
	- Default values / Null values
	- Check constraints
4. Create a physical model for your group project theme
5. Describe your physical model

In the 9/12 class session, your physical model will undergo peer review which you will use to improve your physical model ahead of the next assignment.
